WORK EXPERIENCE
Team Lead / Programmer, Self-Created Studio, International
Mar 2020 - Sep 2022
When I was a high-school student I started self-studying game development and programming in general.

After 1,5 years of learning I decided to team-up with some artist to create our first game. So I found a young brazilian artist on the community website of the Game Maker Engine.

During the development our team had grown to 4 people as we added music composer and sound designer. Both of them were twice as old as me at that moment but I still managed to coordinate our team-work despite the fact that all the team-members worked for free, driven by the game idea and possible revenue share as a result.

After 2 years of hard work and at the cost of our spare time we finished the game called Sunset Forest under the name of TTI Studio .
