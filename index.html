          <p>
            After 1,5 years of self-studying game design and programming I
            gathered a team to develop our first indie-game. The team consisted
            of 4 people from different parts of the world and we used English
            for communication.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a leader of the team I had to manage such things as cooperation
            of different team members and their roles, design ideas and
            marketing strategy. After 2 years of working remotely we finished
            our game called "Sunset Forest". I registered the team under the
            name of TTI Studio and we successfully launch it.

            Translated the rule book for Counter Attack Board Game from English
            to Russian. Used my soccer experience and game design skills to
            suggest the game creators some new ideas as well.

          <!-- <p>
            Once I have seen an advertisement for a board game about soccer. I
            really liked it but unfortunately the price was too high for me at
            that moment. Then I decided to try contacting the game creators.
            After a small friendly conversation I offered them translating the
            game rule book from English to Russian.
          </p>

          <p>
            After I finished the work they sent me a game copy with some gifts
            and a little tip besides that. We still keep the contact with the
            game creators while the Counter Attack Board Game community is
            growing rapidly all over the world.
