          <p>
            When I was a high-school student I started self-studying game
            development and programming in general. After 1,5 years of learning
            I decided to team-up with some artist to create our first game.
          </p>

          <p>
            So I found a young brazilian artist on the community website of the
            Game Maker Engine. During the development our team had grown to 4
            people as we added music composer and sound designer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both of them were twice as old as me at that moment but I still
            managed to coordinate our team-work despite the fact that all the
            team-members worked for free, driven by the game idea and possible
            revenue share as a result.
          </p>
          <p>
            After 2 years of hard work and at the cost of our spare time we
            finished the game called
            <a href="https://thirty-three-infinities.itch.io/sunset-forest"
              >Sunset Forest</a

            under the name of
            <a href="https://thirty-three-infinities.itch.io/">TTI Studio</a>.
